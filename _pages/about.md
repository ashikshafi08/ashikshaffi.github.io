As a dynamic Computer Science graduate from Illinois Institute of Technology, I blend academic excellence with a unique 'learning by hacking' ethos. My journey is characterized by a zeal for tackling complex projects, breaking them down to their fundamentals, and reconstructing them with enhanced functionality. This methodical, exploratory approach has been pivotal in my development across machine learning, data analysis, and software development arenas. 

My professional stint at NeuralMetrics.ai and as a Teaching Assistant has sharpened my command over Python, various machine learning frameworks, and statistical methods. My engagement in open-source projects further underscores my commitment to collaborative development and community contribution in the tech sphere.

As a tech lead and website manager for Phi Kappa Sigma, I've effectively utilized technology to drive community engagement and operational efficiency, honing my leadership skills and understanding of technology’s role in organizational dynamics.

My professional philosophy is simple yet profound: identify a challenge, dissect it to its core, and rebuild it with enhanced insights and functionality. This ‘hacking’ mindset, combined with my experience in open-source collaboration and leadership, fuels my passion for continuous learning and problem-solving. I am eager to apply this versatile and innovative skill set to tackle diverse technological challenges and contribute meaningfully in a dynamic professional environment.
